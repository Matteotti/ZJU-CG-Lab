This repo was forked from [ZJU-CG-Lab](https://github.com/Matteotti/ZJU-CG-Lab).

Currently, the repo could render .obj files, and have several components including Camera, Mesh, Transform, Renderer, Rigidbody, Collider, Light, Matrial, Shader, Texture.

This is a group assignment, so it's not solely my work. Up until February 29, 2024, all parts related to physics simulation and some of the rendering were written by me. I plan to gradually update this repository from now on.
